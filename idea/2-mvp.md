# What will be really useful to me?

## My wishlist

- If I am feeling like really bad, I wanna just pour myself out and get response based on that particular context and maybe some information about me in the past. Like RAG.
- Something that can give me nuggets of wisdom from my past entry everyday or give me reminders so that I can revise them or remember them better.
- Then I want analysis and insights. Something to detect themes, keywords, and emotional tone — helping me see patterns in your own mind.
- Also I want organization of my entries by themes: loneliness, insecure, etc.
- A tool that extracts and organizes life lessons or “principles” from your journals. Add a daily random “principle” popup, or use it as part of your morning journaling ritual.
- Combine your own notes + reflection prompts for a structured journaling companion. Something that surfaces a random quote or note from your past. It then generates reflection prompts like:
  - “How do you feel about this now?”
  - “What did this belief protect you from?”
  - “Would you still agree with this today

## MVP

- RAG system because it is the bedrock of everything else.

## Future possibilities

1. I can have an MCP server to organize rough data that I enter. For the time being I will manually clean the data because it is not much.
